There are two ways to experience the Giant’s Causeway… visit the stones or take the road less travelled and see the UNESCO World Heritage Site on a stunning five-mile hike along the thrilling clifftop path.

The Giant’s Causeway Clifftop Experience is a unique opportunity to see Northern Ireland's only World Heritage Site like never before! Delivered by the National Trust in partnership with local tour company 'Away a Wee Walk', this fully guided hike offers an alternative route to the Giant’s Causeway, boasting many undiscovered views of the coast line.

Visitors will be rewarded with a ‘new’ and rarely seen view of the Giant’s Causeway as they approach the stones at the end of a spectacular walk, taking in incredible clifftop views truly unique to the Causeway Coast and Northern Ireland.

Beginning at Dunseverick Castle, the walk covers five spectacular miles of wonderful wild and rugged coastal scenery along grass and gravel paths, offering walkers the opportunity to see much more of the World Heritage Site than most people even know exists!
